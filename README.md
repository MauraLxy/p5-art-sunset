# After Hours

I introduce 4 concepts of "after hours" in my artwork. The overall window board is the first concept meaning "my" after hours which is looking through the window and observing. The 3 windows each representing 1 concept: the pedestrain rushes to catch the bus after her working hours; you greet your friends after their course hours; the street is taken over by wind after hours.
As a viewer, you will first see the window page where you can see distant buildings, sunsets and a cat. If you click the cat, she will purrrrr (Hope you like cats) There are 3 windows ahead, each with one click will show a string of number. You need to press the corresponding keys to play the tunes to enter different pages. In the first page, you can move the background and figure pieces to the box and different combinations will lead to different results. In the second page, you are expected to greet your friends on the street with your microphone. Try to speak loud so that they can notice you. In the third page, you can drag your mouse to wipe the board and look for some interesting facts about moon.
